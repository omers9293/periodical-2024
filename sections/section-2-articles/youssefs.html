        <p class="paragraphText">Water is the fuel of life on this planet, people drink it, bathe in it, but many don't know its other equally important use: electricity.Through harnessing the power of chemical processes, water may be transformed into a source of power which is better for the environment than most others. This article hopes to explain how this process works.</p>

        <h2 class="articleSubHeader">The Basics:</h2>
        <p class="paragraphText">Water, or H20, is a molecule made up of 3 atoms: two hydrogen and one oxygen atom. This molecule can be utilized to release energy through a chemical process called electrolysis.</p>
        <h2 class="articleSubHeader">Electrolysis: Breaking Down Water</h2>

        <p class="paragraphText"> Electrolysis is a chemical process where water is split into hydrogen and oxygen. This happens by running an electric current through the water. This energy for the electrical current can come from the sun or other renewable sources. Here’s a basic reaction:
        <p class="paragraphText">2H2O (liquid) —> 2H2 (gas) + O2 (gas)</p>
        <div class="articleImageContainer">
            <img class="articleImage" src="../../src/electro.jpeg" style="box-shadow: none;">
        </div>
        <p class="paragraphText">If we have hydrogen gas we can use it in a hydrogen fuel cell. A hydrogen fuel cell mixes hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity, with water being the only waste, as seen in the chemical reaction below. The chemical reaction in a fuel cell is:</p>
        <p class="paragraphText">2H2 + O2 —> 2H2O + energy (electricity)</p>
        <p class="paragraphText">When a reaction contains multiple atoms which come together to form one molecule, that reaction has a higher chance of being exothermic (especially at lower temperatures), meaning that the formation of the new molecule will release more energy into the surroundings than is absorbed when the bonds of the reactants are broken in order to begin the formation. This causes a current of electricity which can power things like vehicles.</p>
        <h2 class="articleSubHeader">Real Life Examples:</h2>

<ul class="listStyle">
  <li>Hydrogen fuel cell cars, the Toyota Mirai, a car run strictly on hydrogen which is produced by a hydrogen station which pumps hydrogen into the car to power it, making the waste water vapor.</li>
  <li>Hydrogen powered buses in Philadelphia, California, and Nevada are beginning to use hydrogen fuel cells to power their buses for cleaner energy.</li>
</ul>
