        <p class="paragraphText">Water is the fuel of life on this planet, people drink it, bathe in it, but many don't know its other equally important use: electricity.Through harnessing the power of chemical processes, water may be transformed into a source of power which is better for the environment than most others. This article hopes to explain how this process works.</p>

        <p class="paragraphText">During the last hundred years, industrialisation has grown at a fast rate. For instance, real manufacturing construction spending in the USA has more than doubled since 2021. It has thus increased the demand for exploitation of the Earth's natural resources at a careless rate, which has exacerbated the world's problem of environmental pollution. Heavy metals which are released into the atmosphere during mining, smelting, and other industrial processes return to the land through dry and wet deposition. Discharge of wastewaters such as industrial effluents and domestic sewage add heavy metals to the environment. Application of chemical fertilizers and combustion of fossil fuels also contribute to the anthropogenic input of heavy metals in the environment. The environment has been seriously polluted by several pollutants such as inorganic ions, organic pollutants, organometallic compounds, radioactive isotopes, gaseous pollutants and nanoparticles. Chemical pollutants such as lead, mercury, cadmium, copper, nickel, chromium and pesticides can also cause long-term health problems like cancer, kidney and liver failure and neurological damage. Researchers calculated that more than 1.8 million deaths were caused by toxic chemical pollution, increasing by 66 percent since 2000.</p>

        <p class="paragraphText"> Additionally, water pollution inevitably creates dead zones, which are low oxygen (or hypoxic) areas within worldwide oceans and lakes, where excess of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizers and sewage runoff jumpstart the eutrophication process, creating a haven for cyanobacteria, or green blue algae, as well as other plants in the body of water. This can be harmful to the aquatic ecosystem because certain species of cyanobacteria such as microcystis, anabaena and cylindrospermopsis are particularly dangerous because they produce toxins that are harmful for human, animals, and aquatic life. Also overgrown algae prevent light from penetrating the water’s surface, shutting off underwater plants from photosynthesizing.The amount of dead zones over the years has risen exponentially. There were only ten recorded dead zones in 1960, but now there are over 400 identified dead zones mostly located in areas along the east coastlines of the United States and the Baltic Sea, as well as both Japan and the Korean Peninsula. These dead zones also prevent the organisms beneath them from receiving oxygen, which has led to the populations of biodiversity of benthic (bottom-dwelling) ocean species being greatly reduced.
        <p class="paragraphText">In only the past 60 years, pollution has reshaped the planet and as the oceanographer Jacques Cousteau said “water and air, the two essential fluids on which all life depends, have become global garbage cans.” To prevent the escalation of water pollution and its harmful consequences, agricultural practices should be optimized by using precision farming techniques, applying fertilizers judiciously, and establishing buffer strips along waterways to capture runoff. And the best way to prevent the creation of dead zones is upgrading wastewater treatment facilities ro remove more nitrogen and phosphorus before discharge is also critical.</p>
