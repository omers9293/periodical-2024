        <p class="paragraphText">	Water is essential for food production because plants consist of about 80-95% of water and also need water for many reasons. Some of these reasons include photosynthesis, cooling, and the transport of nutrients and minerals from soil and into the plant. Just like how us humans need water to survive, plants are also like that. Plants have needs just like us. Water is essentially food for them in which they need a huge supply of.</p>

        <p class="paragraphText">To further explain why, water is required for a seed to sprout because without water, the process of plant growth wouldn’t be accomplished. Photosynthesis is one of the many reasons why water is extremely necessary for plants. Through the process of photosynthesis, plants use energy from the sun to create their own food. While this happens, plants use carbon dioxide from the air and hydrogen from the water to allow the water to absorb through their roots and release oxygen. It is like an exchange. Water is responsible for cell structural supports. Water also evaporates on the leaves because it helps them from overheating. Plants can die from dehydration. Low moisture results in the browning of plant tissues which eventually leads to plant death. This shows how crucial water is for a plant’s survival.</p>
