        <p class="paragraphText">The universe's most important liquid, water, cannot dissolve living organisms. From this, you might have concluded that water is a horrible solvent, but that’s not the case. Water is known to be one of the best solvents used in laboratory experiments when it comes to dissolving different substances. So why is that? Well, there are two main reasons, the first being water’s polarity, and the second being the ability to form Hydrogen bonding. </p>

        <p class="paragraphText"><i>In this picture, NaCl (s) was dissolved in water leading to Cl- and Na+. The positive poles of the water are facing towards the Cl-, while the negative poles of water are facing Na+. The water surrounds the whole entire ion, making them unable to become NaCl (s) again.</i></p>
        <p class="paragraphText">Besides this property of water, water is also made up of H and O, which means it can form something we call hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bonding is just a term to describe the attraction between molecules. In terms of intermolecular forces, hydrogen bonding is the strongest of them all, meaning breaking the attraction will take much more energy. As you can imagine, the attraction created will be super strong to the point where it will disrupt the forces within solute molecules, therefore dissolving it. To illustrate what I mean you can imagine two people, Bob and Pinky, each trying to win over an animal in a barn that contains only 2 baby bears. One bear might want to go with Bob, while the other might want to go with pinky due to the fact that the bears like different people. This separates the bears, and once the bear is close to Bob, it will be harder to reunite with the other bear that is close to Pinky since Bob and Pinky will be in their way. This idea of separation, and blockage is what hydrogen bonding in water does to the substances. In short, the solvent will be attracted to the polarity of the water molecule depending on its polarity, thus dissolving the substance.</p>

        <p class="paragraphText"><i>The hydrogen bonding between the molecules surrounding Na+, and Cl- are creating an intermolecular force called hydrogen bonding that stops the ions from bonding which each other thus reforming NaCl (s)</i></p>
        <p class="paragraphText">In summary, the properties of water such as polarity and hydrogen bonding, allow for water to one, break the attraction between the solvent, and two take away each particle one by one, resulting in the substance being dissolved. Now that you know water’s power, you should avoid water at all costs … just kidding, we humans cannot be dissolved in water thankfully.</p>
