        <p class="paragraphText">Hard water is very different from water due to different elements that are contained inside. Hard water was formed when water was percolated through the deposition of limestone, chalk and gypsum which contains large amounts of minerals, calcium and magnesium. Although there are no dangerous health problems in drinking hard water, the excess calcium inside the hard water can cause the kidney to work harder in filtering leading to stomach upset, nausea, and constipation.</p>

        <p class="paragraphText">When using hard water to wash hands and hair may show signs of discomfort. For instance, the minerals inside the hard water react with most of the soaps which can lead to a problem of “soap scum”. When your skin makes contact with soap scum, it can trap your natural oil and lead to the formation of blemishes. The form of blemishes can lead to issues for breakouts especially young people that are susceptible to eczema. When using hard water in bathing, it can lead to your skin being dry, itchy and discomfortness. For places where people use hard water on teeth cleaning, the minerals in hard water might be stuck on your teeths surface. It won't really have bad effects unless the minerals in the hard water are very hard. In hard water, the hardness of the mineral can lead to a change of pH in your skin. It can weaken your resistance to harmful bacteria and infections. Minerals around 7-11 gpg already can count as dangerous, and anything above that is harmful.</p>

        <p class="paragraphText">Not talking about the danger that hard water can do to our health, hard water can cause problems to the surroundings. Due to large amounts of minerals and metals, it can cause damage in pipes where we store hard waters. How can you figure out if you were drinking hard water? If you ever drink hard water, you will feel a sense of bitterness and saltiness. You can nearly find hard water inside wells because the mineral in the soil can leech through and go into the water.</p>
