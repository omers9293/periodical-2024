        <p class="paragraphText">Many people find the popular children's cartoon "Avatar: the Last Airbender" to contain very fascinating concepts. In it, the main character can bend the elements to his will, constantly using the makeup of the environment around him to his advantage. This premise has left viewers wondering: can people manipulate the elements of the real world? Particularly, is it possible to waterbend just like how characters in the show manipulate water?</p>
        <p class="paragraphText">Waterbending can be explained through science, more specifically chemistry. Chemistry revolves around the study of matter, its properties, composition, etc. When an atom becomes an ion (charged particle) it will either gain or lose  electrons, and a negatively charged anion or positively charged cation respectively is formed. Like the same charges repel and opposite charges attract. This fundamental principle is applied throughout the entire universe, and makes the manipulation of water possible through the power of chemistry and physics.</p>
        <p class="paragraphText">Water molecules are made up of an oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms. The atoms have a partial charge due to unequal sharing of electrons in the covalent bonds within the atoms. Oxygen, being an electronegative atom, will attract the lone electron of the hydrogen atoms away, leaving the hydrogen atom with a partial positive charge. However, the whole molecule remains neutral because the positive charges of hydrogen cancels out the negative charge of oxygen. The partial charges contribute to its polar structure, allowing it to be affected by exterior forces.</p>

        <p class="paragraphText">When you hold a negatively charged balloon up to water, its structure is bent due to the electric forces between oxygen's negative charge and the balloonâ€™s negative charge. </p>

        <p class="paragraphText">Waterbending is possible, but not to the extreme seen in fantasy shows. You would have to bypass the laws of physics, exert an improbable amount of energy and force, and with centuries of scientific discoveries and experiments, there has not yet been a successful experiment that involved this type of waterbending. Waterbending seen in Avatar is based on a bit of real world science, but no amount of training will turn this fiction into reality.</p>
