        <p class="paragraphText">Freshwater is defined as naturally occurring water that is safe to drink due to its low concentrations of salt and other intrusions. Unlike other forms of water found across the globe, freshwater is able to be cleaned and consumed by humans! However, freshwater isn’t as abundant as you’d think, as only 1.2 percent of the amount of water that's on the Earth is freshwater. A large majority of freshwater on Earth is either stored in glaciers, ice caps, permafrost or buried deep in the ground as groundwater. Only a small percentage of freshwater is found in bodies of water on the surface (such as lakes and rivers). For example, places in the US such as Kentucky and Lake Michigan hold some of Earth’s liquid freshwater in groundwater, swamp water, rivers, and lakes. This state alone carries about 169.5 miles in diameter of a circle in Kentucky. This much water could be used, but most of it is underground and unavailable to humans. Underground sources hold 22,339 miles³ worth of water and would have a height of 35 miles high if it was a circle.</p>

        <p class="paragraphText">Most of the freshwater we drink comes from rivers and streams, which we access from an array of pipes, canals, and pumping stations. Since most of our freshwater is either underground or frozen, we rely on these bodies of freshwater a lot! Freshwater plays a huge role in our daily lives, since we use it for many purposes such as taking showers, brushing our teeth, and preparing food. In addition, freshwater is used for thermoelectric power, irrigation, public supplies, self-supplied industrial, aquaculture, mining, and self supplied domestic uses. Some domestic uses for freshwater include: washing our clothing, drinking water, and washing ourselves.</p>
