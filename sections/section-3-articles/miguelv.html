        <p class="paragraphText">Though New York is surrounded by water on all sides, it is still relatively water scarce. The East river, sitting east of Manhattan, isn’t really a river, but a tidal estuary, therefore it does not contain any water. The Hudson river, though it is a river, only becomes usable drinking water around the Tappan Zee bridge (officially the Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge) and Poughkeepsie. During the 17th and 18th centuries upon the establishment and founding of New York, settlers had only one clean water source. This water source was a 60 ft deep pond called  Collect pond located in what is now lower Manhattan. Due to overpopulation Collect pond was ridden with pollution and unfit for consumption. In modern day, New York gets its water from a series of 19 reservoirs and 3 controlled lakes./p>

        <p class="paragraphText">The Catskill/Delaware watershed (Ashokan, Rondout, Neversink, Pepacton, Cannonsville, and Schoharie reservoirs ) alone holds 460 billion gallons of New York’s water. To maintain the Watershed the DEP hired nearly 1000 engineers and scientists along with a 200 officer police department patrolling the watershed by car, boat and helicopter to ensure safety. The Catskill/Delaware watersheds provide 90% of New York's water supply with the rest coming from the Croton Watershed. Of the millions of gallons held within these reservoirs, not one is filtered making the Catskill/Delaware watershed the largest unfiltered water supply in the country. The issue is transporting the sheer quantity of water that is needed for New York city 120 miles from the Catskill/Delaware reservoir within range of the City. With a population of approximately 8.3 million people, the city uses 680,000 gallons of water per minute or roughly the equivalent of an olympic sized swimming pool. The quite ingenious solution to this problem was the Catskill aqueduct (completed in 1915) and the Delaware aqueduct (completed in 1945), a continuous 85 mile tunnel, the longest tunnel at the time by 56 miles. Though most aqueducts work by using several segments that drop in elevation, the innovative and ingenious nature of the Delaware aqueduct lies in the execution as it essentially functions as an inverted siphon. The theory behind a siphon and what works to our advantage is that a liquid sent through a tube will always return to its source elevation.

        <p class="paragraphText">Nearly half a century ago a leak below the Hudson river was found, resulting in millions of gallons leaking, flooding and water contamination for us and the Hudson, a diversion tunnel was made to address the issue. The Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) shut down the Delaware aqueduct in October of 2024 for approximately 5-8 months until the spring of 2025 to make reparations for the leakage. This means that the Croton aqueduct, the smaller of the three, will have to make up for the absence of the Delaware Aqueduct.
        <p class="paragraphText">The Kensico Reservoir is the first point in the process where any additives are used. Up to this point, sampling allows the DEP to detect everything that's in the water. At the exit tunnels of the Kensico Reservoir, chlorine is added to kill microorganisms. The water later reaches the hillview reservoir where chlorine is once again added. After this the water goes to the Richmond Chlorination Facility in Staten Island where chlorine is added along with fluorine to fight cavities, orthophosphate is added to mitigate lead leakage, and sodium hydroxide to balance the pH. Apart from additives, water is also treated at the Catskill-Delaware Ultraviolet Water Treatment Facility, but not all of New York’s water passes through here. Though the billions of gallons that are a result of the Catskill/Delaware watershed the remaining 10% of New York’s water supply coming from the Croton watershed does require filtration. First air is added to bring particles and solids to the surface for skimming, before the aforementioned chlorine, fluorine, orthophosphate, and sodium hydroxide are added to make this water drinkable. From there the 3 main tunnels provide this water to every mainline to provide every person with water.</p>
