        <h2 class="articleSubHeader">Where is the Los Angeles Reservoir Located?</h2>
        <p class="paragraphText">The Los Angeles Reservoir is located in the neighborhood of Sylmar, Los Angeles, California. Shade balls are only found in the Ivanhoe Reservoir, one of the two reservoirs in the Los Angeles Reservoir, the other being the Silver Lake Reservoir. Ivanhoe and Silver Lake are divided by a spillway which is an outlet that passes excess water safely in the case of a flood. 3.3 billion gallons of water fill the Ivanhoe Reservoir, and annually, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) predicts that the shade balls will conserve millions of gallons on its 96 acres. Microdyne Plastics, the production company behind shade balls, approximated the cost to be 250 million dollars, with each shade ball costing 33¢.</p>

        <h2 class="articleSubHeader">So What is the Purpose of Releasing 96 Million Shade Balls in the Los Angeles Reservoir?</h2>
        <p class="paragraphText">When naturally occurring bromide found in the Ivanhoe reservoir is combined with ozone and a combination of sunlight and chlorine, bromate is created. Chlorine is added as a disinfectant to discourage algae growth and the bromate it helps produce can wreak havoc on human nervous, digestive and urinary systems if ingested in high concentrations. In the chemical equation for the creation of bromate, chlorine acts as a catalyst which speeds up the process of ozonation. </p>
        <p class="paragraphText">Chemical reaction for the creation of bromate: Br<sup>-</sup> + O<sub>3</sub> → BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> </p>
        <p class="paragraphText">Bromate is a carcinogenic chemical compound, and is difficult to remove from drinking water. The shade balls rectify this issue by preventing sunlight from reaching the chlorine underwater, thus preventing bromate from being formed as well as reducing water evaporation. Contrary to popular belief, shade balls do not increase the temperature of the water. Typically, black tends to absorb and retain heat more effectively than white colors, but according to the LADWP, shade balls reduce water evaporation to as much as 85-90%.</p>

        <h2 class="articleSubHeader">Why are Shade Balls Black and Not White and What are the Advantages of this Colour?</h2>
        <p class="paragraphText">Shade balls, being the black color they are, deflect UV rays. Their composition includes high-density polyethylene and the colorant carbon black, which prevents sunlight from entering the waters. Therefore, the black color will repel the UV rays better than any other color, preventing sunlight from sparking hazardous bromate-producing reactions that lead to the growth of algae in the reservoir</p>

        <h2 class="articleSubHeader">What are the Drawbacks and Critiques of Using Shade Balls?</h2>
        <p class="paragraphText">Though shade balls are necessary to combat chemical reactions in the city of Los Angeles's drinking water, critics argue that these balls possibly leach Bisphenol A, more commonly known as BPA, hence contaminating drinking water. Although the plastic released in the water is HDPE (High-Density Poly Ethylene composed of petroleum material), a low-risk plastic chemical-wise, the carbon black which gives the shade balls their color is a known carcinogen. Carbon black is often associated with cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and lung fibrosis.</p>
        <p class ="paragraphText">Shade balls significantly reduce the potentially hazardous bromate reaction in the reservoir, but they may not be as effective in conserving water. The yearly savings, which amount to roughly 2 million, are disproportionate to the yearly cost of 34.5 million to upkeep the shade balls. Additionally, the shade balls must be replaced every 10 years. Repercussions of using a poor weathering plastic include its lack of resistance to oxidizing acids and chlorinated hydrocarbons.</p>
        <p class="paragraphText">The production of shade balls requires more water than is conserved. Some environmentalists contend that shade balls are not the most environmentally friendly and sustainable option.</p>
        <p class="paragraphText">In the state of California, the Clean Water Act, an EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) requirement, can be associated with the usage of shade balls. Shade balls allow the city of Los Angeles to avoid violations from civil penalties. Founded during Nixon’s presidency, the EPA strived to reduce environmental pollution and its detrimental consequences on the health of humans. Through state legislation, the EPA mandated water usage in reservoirs such as ones in Silver Lake.</p>

        <h2 class="articleSubHeader">Takeaway</h2>
        <p class="paragraphText">As 96 million shade balls are deployed in the Ivanhoe Reservoir per decade, a chemical process aiding in the formation of bromate (BrO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) is averted. Though the city of Los Angeles argues that shade balls are necessary to conserve and prevent harmful water from entering citizens’ water pipes, critics think otherwise as they are a means of evasion for civil fines.</p>
