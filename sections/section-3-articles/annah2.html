        <h2 class="articleSubHeader">How is the Taj Mahal Affected by Acid Rain?</h2>
        <p class="paragraphText">The once-pearly white structure of the Taj Mahal is turning yellow and it is becoming a cause of concern. Located in Agra, India, the Taj is a popular tourist site attracting 7-8 million annual visitors. This structure’s discoloration is largely a result of acid rain as the Taj Mahal is made of marble, a metal carbonate. Acid rain is especially harmful to buildings and structures made of stone, marble, or metal. When the marble from the structure reacts with various acids, the reaction results in a corrosive effect that alters the color of the white marble.</p>
        <h2 class="articleSubHeader">What is the Chemical Equation Responsible for the Corrosion of the Taj Mahal?</h2>
        <p class="paragraphText">SO2 (Sulphur dioxide gas) & NO2 (Nitrous oxide gas) are released into the air when wood, petroleum, and other sources of fuels are burned by factories such as the Mathura Refinery in Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, India. As these toxic gases are released into the atmosphere, they can form sulphuric, nitrous, and sulfurous acid. The acids above react with water vapor/rainwater, causing acid rain. </p>
        <p class="paragraphText">Shown below is a sequence of chemical equations when sulfurous acid experiences dissolution in water:</p>
        <p class="paragraphText">H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O ⇄ HSO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> + H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup></p>
        <p class="paragraphText">HSO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O ⇄ HSO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> + H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup></p>
        <p class="paragraphText">The acid-base reaction that occurs when calcium carbonate reacts with sulphuric acid:</p>
        <p class="paragraphText">CaCO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> → CaSO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub></p>
        <p class="paragraphText">Calcium carbonate derived from the marble of the Taj Mahal combined with Sulfuric acid in acid rain produces products: calcium sulfate, water, and carbon dioxide. Calcium sulfate, one of the proposed products in the chemical reaction, contributes to the marble's yellow tint. The yellowing of the Taj Mahal structure and its corrosion is largely attributed to marble leprosy (marble cancer), a process defined by the corrosion of marble. </p>

        <h2 class="articleSubHeader">How can the Taj Mahal be Saved from Acid Rain?</h2>
        <p class="paragraphText">Industries located near the Taj Mahal have been mandated to utilize clean fuels including CNG, a compressed natural gas alternative to the typical petrol and diesel fuel used in domestic & industrial facilities. Additionally, India’s Supreme Court suggests motorists in the surrounding area of the Taj convert to unleaded gasoline, a more eco-friendly fuel that releases fewer emissions. Pollutants released into the environment are the primary contributors to acid rain, and therefore, preventing the formation of acid rain is crucial to infrastructure in developed countries such as India.</p>
        <h2 class="articleSubHeader">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="paragraphText">Polluted air surrounding the Taj Mahal monument in the Indian city of Agra poses a great threat to the marble material. From a milky white marble to a yellowish tint due to processes known as discoloration and deterioration, the Taj will continue to yellow if further action is not taken. Environmentalists suggest the reduction of air emissions within a certain mile-radius of the structure. Implementing cleaner fuels and fewer industrial activities can help preserve the Taj, ensuring its beauty for future years to come.</p>
