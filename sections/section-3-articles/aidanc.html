        <p class="paragraphText">Wastewater treatment is an important process to ensure water safety and environmental protection. Although we cannot use this water, this process ensures the local ecosystems stays safe as the water is discharged into the nearby ocean. Wastewater is any water used in everyday business, from the water you wash your dishes with to bath and even toilet water. The diagram above outlines the key stages of primary and secondary wastewater treatment.</p>
            <ul class="listStyle">
                <li>
                    <p class="paragraphText">1) Preliminary Treatment: This stage involves straining where large solids are removed from the wastewater as it enters the treatment plant. Objects like rags, sticks, and other debris are filtered out in order to prevent damage to equipment in later stages.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="paragraphText">2)Primary Sedimentation: Wastewater flows to a sedimentation tank where heavier organic and inorganic materials sink to the bottom. These settled materials, known as sludge, accumulate at the bottom and are removed. This step removes solids and some of the organic matter.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="paragraphText">3)Aeration: Water flows into an aeration tank. Here, air is pumped into the water to promote growth of beneficial bacteria. These bacteria break down organic matter in the wastewater. However, more needs to be done since there is still remaining phosphates in the water that can cause eutrophication in the nearby water (see next section).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="paragraphText">4)Secondary Sedimentation: Water proceeds into another sedimentation tank. Here, the bacteria and other microorganisms now precipitate into particles called floc, settle down. This removes a significant amount of the remaining organic material.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="paragraphText">5)Disinfection: Before the treated water is discharged into the ocean, it is disinfected, killing remaining pathogens. Common methods include adding chlorine or using ultraviolet light.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="paragraphText">6)Sludge Treatment: Throughout the treatment process, sludge accumulates and is treated separately. It may be anaerobically digested to reduce volume and decompose much of the organic material, then further processed and used as fertilizer.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h2 class="articleSubHeader">Why is this Needed?</h2>
        <p class="paragraphText">If we discharge untreated wastewater into the ocean, it would significantly impact the local marine ecosystem. A major concern is eutrophication. This process occurs when large quantities of nutrients, such as phosphates, enter a body of water. This leads to a dramatic increase in algae populations, which disrupts the entire food chain and decreases dissolved oxygen, making it unlivable for other organisms. This long-term ecological damage is nearly irreversible.</p>
        <p class="paragraphText">Each of these steps plays a role in converting wastewater into liquid that is safe enough to be released into the environment, protecting marine ecosystems and public health.</p>
