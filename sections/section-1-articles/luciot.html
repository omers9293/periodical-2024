        <p class="paragraphText">Saltwater and freshwater. It’s one of earth's many natural phenomenons that can occur in this world. As humans, saltwater is not something we can’t rely on because of the high salt concentration in the water. Our bodies aren't made to balance out the excess salt that ocean water contains. And plus, have you ever accidentally swallowed ocean water? It’s saltier than someone who lost in their favorite video game. However, many other aquatic organisms have evolved over time to be able to not only survive, but also rely on the salty ocean water. In a study done by The American Museum of Natural History, they stated that since the ocean has a high salt content, fish need to drink mass amounts of water to balance out and filter the salt. They have special cells in the gills and organs such as the kidneys that help with this process of filtration(AMNH). Freshwater fish on the other hand, since their habitat has a lower salt concentration do not have the same cells as saltwater fish. Freshwater fish have evolved to hold the concentration of salt inside their bodies(Scientific American). Freshwater fish have cells in their bodies that help them pump in salt due to the fact that they still need to have a certain level of salt. But since they live in freshwater, their bodies need to do this so they can survive(Mcgill). </p>

        <p class="paragraphText">Evolution throughout the years has caused these aquatic species to adapt to their environment unlike us humans, who can't rely on saltwater as a reliable source of hydration. The salt levels in the water is too much for our blood and kidneys to handle. The salty water would just absorb into our bloodstream and our kidneys would have to work overtime just to filter out the small amount of salt water that entered our bodies. This is why when you accidentally drink saltwater, your body feels even thirstier. We need more water to help our kidneys filter out the salt that enters our blood(AMNH).</p>
        <p class="paragraphText">Taking a step back for a second, let's talk about the fish cells. The specific cell that saltwater fish have that helps them pump out the excess concentration of salt in their bodies is called chloride cells. These cells produce an enzyme called gill Na+/K+ ATpase, which in other words is a sodium-potassium pump that helps filter out the salt from a fish's body(Scientific American). Since other organisms lack this cell, they can not survive in the high concentrations of salt found in ocean water. Sea life has been evolving for hundreds of millions of years now. With every generation of evolution making the following generation better. Saltwater and freshwater fish have had the best evolution being able to adapt and overcome their challenges found in their habitats. </p>
