        <p class="paragraphText">In many places around the world, there would often be large bodies of water. What happens if a different body of water mixed with another large amount of water collides? Would it mix to create a unique and combined water?</p>

        <p class="paragraphText">In the Gulf of Alaska, there is a place where you can see the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean collide with each other. This is because it is being shown that the glacier is meeting with the “offshore”. The glaciers contain freshwater and also often delay the oceans from mixing. This type of interaction explains the difference in color. The two oceans would mix, but they wouldn’t have the same features due to the differences in density, temperature, and salt between the two oceans. Depending on the ocean’s location on the globe, the ocean would adapt to the cold or hot temperatures which make the ocean that temperature. The average temperature in Celsius is 21°-27° for the Pacific Ocean. As for the Atlantic Ocean, the average temperature in Celsius is 12.7°- 20.5°. This means that the Atlantic Ocean is colder than the Pacific Ocean. There’s also a huge difference in salt most likely due to its temperature difference. While cold water tends to dissolve less salt, warmer surface water experiences greater salt dissolution rates. Salt affects the density of the ocean waters, it affects their masses, their evaporation and precipitation, and also the water’s freshness. The density aids in this reaction because it shows the difference in the behavior of the two oceans. There is also a difference in the strength of molecular connections between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. The molecules in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans make it harder for them to mix and form. They have different flows and surface tensile strength. The surface tensile strength means that the two oceans have different surface tension between each other because of the difference in depth, and also the flow between both waters is different in direction. This means that the ocean’s ability to mix would be quite difficult but it does mix within time.</p>
        <p class="paragraphText">What does that mean for the animals? Well, some species can easily adapt to changes in waters (which gives them the potential to survive in both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans), while other species may not survive because of the change in temperature, environment, different animals, and water pressure. The animals who could live through the change could potentially be a threat or an invasive species in the ocean. An example of an invasive species that could harm other ocean animals is a lionfish. Lionfish are labeled as invasive species because they can live through a wide range of temperatures, salinity levels, and limited predators. They can be harmful to the ecosystem because they consume a large quantity of fish. Those fishes help consume algae, and the disappearance of fishes can lead to overgrowth of algae. The algae would then damage the coral reef population and the habitat for other animals and environments.</p>

        <p class="paragraphText">Overall, the Pacific and Atlantic oceans do mix but don’t share the same properties because of their geographical location, the large quantities of the salt, temperature differences, and the difference in density. The Atlantic Ocean has more salt than the Pacific Ocean because of more heat and increased water evaporation.</p>
