        <p class="paragraphText">Have you ever wondered why the ocean is salty but rivers aren't? The answer involves rain, rocks, and rivers working together over millions of years. The salinity of water bodies, particularly oceans, originates from rock weathering on land. Rainwater, which is somewhat acidic from dissolved carbon dioxide, reacts with rocks as it runs over them. This reaction gradually breaks down the rocks, releasing salt, chloride, and other minerals into the water. Rivers and streams deliver these dissolved minerals into the oceans. Even though the concentration of salt in river water isn't as significant as you'd expect, the constant movement of water throughout billions of years and many geological time frames has resulted in the ocean's current salinity.  In simple terms, ocean salinity comes from the constant process of rainwater-induced rock weathering and the resulting movement of dissolved ions into aquatic environments.

        <p class="paragraphText">Another major factor contributing to the ocean's salinity is evaporation. As ocean water evaporates due to the Sun’s heat, the salts remain in the water. As a result, the remaining water gets a lot saltier. Salts from the ocean continue to build up over time since there is no natural way to remove them from the ocean’s waters.

        <p class="paragraphText">Lastly, the salinity of the ocean is also increased by geological processes like hydrothermal vents and undersea volcanoes. Seawater penetrates the crust of the Earth, where magma heats it and further dissolves minerals from the rocks. Hydrothermal vents allow the mineral-rich water to return to the ocean. Minerals are also released into the ocean directly by underwater volcanic eruptions. </p>
        <p class="paragraphText">In conclusion, ocean salinity comes from rain breaking down rocks on land, with rivers carrying the minerals to the sea. Evaporation makes the water saltier because the salt stays behind, and things like underwater volcanoes and vents also add minerals to the ocean.</p>
