        <p class="paragraphText">There are two prevailing theories, as suggested by the Planetary Society: either Earth was born with water, or space rocks, asteroids, and comets brought it here. The Quran, a religious scripture preserved for over 1,400 years, states in 23:18, “And We sent down water from the heaven in proper quantity, and we made Earth is dwelling, and We are Able to take it away.”  Although English translations may vary, they all point to the conclusion that Earth didn’t originally have water, and it came from above.</p>

        <p class="paragraphText">While I personally find this perspective compelling as it stems from the Quran, let's seek corroborating evidence from the observable world. However, let's not disregard insights from the unseen realm, as they could offer valuable clues.</p>
        <p class="paragraphText">This leads us to another inquiry: Where did water truly originate? According to the Brookhaven National Laboratory, “Scientists have long speculated that water is trapped in a rocky layer of the Earth's mantle located between the lower mantle and upper mantle, at depths between 250 miles and 410 miles.”</p>

        </div>
        <p class="paragraphText">As water is being discovered in crystal structures, we must ponder the origins of these rocky or crystal-like formations. The Big Bang theory provides reassurance, integrating both visible and unseen world ideologies. “Water was first created in deep space, after hydrogen and oxygen first formed. All hydrogen atoms were created about 380,000 years after the big bang. Oxygen was created much later in the nuclear furnaces of stars, towards the end of their life cycles.” (New Scientist, June 15) The Big Bang theory offers an understanding of our universe from its inception to the present and potentially its end.

        <p class="paragraphText">In conclusion, scientists have yet to provide a definitive answer as they continue to unravel the mysteries of our planets and solar system. Both proponents of the unseen world and those anchored in the tangible world may find common ground, offering some semblance of answers to the lingering questions: What do you believe to be the truth?</p>
