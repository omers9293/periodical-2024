        <h2 class="articleSubHeader">Why Couldn’t We Humans Discover More of the Deeper Ocean?</h2>
        <p class="paragraphText">There is a lot of marine life in the ocean that we humans haven’t discovered yet. This is all because of the intense pressure that the deep ocean has. In regular conditions, humans could only handle 1 atm, but as humans go deeper than sea level it gets pretty risky because the pressure becomes too overwhelming. At sea level, there is about 1 atm, and for every 10 meters of water depth the atm increases by 1. This restricts the amount of discovery that we humans are capable of. It is advised to have some sort of equipment once 20 meters deep in the ocean, because of the danger of pressure. This helps explain why we humans have only explored 5% of the ocean which is about 10916.1072 meters.</p>

        <p class="paragraphText">When humans go explore the lower depths of the ocean without any sort of equipment, there could be a lot of harmful consequences that follow. The first thing anyone would experience is the presence of high pressure. The water pressure will push onto the human body which causes dysfunctional lungs, then pressure will push to the mouth causing the lung to be filled with water instead of air. This will then be followed by a differentiable pressure disparities around the body which would then push the whole body on the helmet. At this point, you’re basically hopeless because of the damages the pressure has done to your body. Organs are misplaced and blood is everywhere causing the person to bleed out from organ failure.</p>

        <p class="paragraphText">Explorers tend to use submersibles to aid them in exploring the deeper ocean; they can withstand high pressure while keeping the people inside safe. Submersibles are vehicles that are used for oceanography, underwater archaeology, ocean exploration, tourism, equipment maintenance recovery, and underwater videography. This helps in collecting data regarding any discovery that is being made. An example of a submersible could be HOV Alvin which is a submarine that can travel up to 6,500 meters for 10 hours. Marine life could be detected by using a device called acoustic mapping system, which includes scanning and provides a detailed map of the sea floor. A deep camera could also be used by explorers as they can study the behavior of marine life. The sampling tool is also a huge part of studies because it can provide details of ecological life in the deep ocean.</p>

        <p class="paragraphText">Deep sea marine life are crucial in our life because it allows scientists to uncover more mysteries that we are unaware of. This can increase our understanding in science research which makes evolution more easier to understand. Deep sea animals play a huge role in carbon sequestration which can help us with climate regulation. As time goes on technology gets more advanced in order to make more discoveries in the deep sea. These marine animals give individuals motivation to create more advances to feed curiosity. </p>
